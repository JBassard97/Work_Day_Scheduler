# Work_Day_Scheduler
## Description
This repository contains the source code for my Work Day Scheduler application! This app allows users to write appointments into each hour's timeslot and save them into local storage so that they persist in between sessions. Each timeslot is also color coded and based on the current hour for easy viewing! 
## Features
This project utilizes several third-party API's, such as Dayjs, JQuery, and Google Fonts. The current time to the second is conveniently displayed at the top and is constantly updating. A theme is applied to each third of the workday, from sunset to nighttime, to give the user that "whole day" vibe.  
## Usage/Deployed Link
The link to the deployed application is: https://jbassard97.github.io/Work_Day_Scheduler/

When loading the application, you're presented with the title of the calendar, the current time, and a horizontal block allocated to each hour of the 9-5 workday. Click on each divider to change its text, then select the blue save button to write it to local storage. This calendar is specific to you, on your device, so no one else will see what's on your agenda. Remember, the best "life-hack" is proper time management!
